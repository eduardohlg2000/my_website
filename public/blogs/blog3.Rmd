# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 



First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hypothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

Null hypothesis: Mean ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton's movies on IMDB are equal
Alternative hypothesis: Mean ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton's movies on IMDB are not equal

You can load the data and examine its structure


```{r load-movies-data}
#Now we first read our data from a csv file them glimpse to analyse it
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}
#Now, we want to select the date that we will use which is the rating and the directors
IMBD <- movies %>% 
  select(rating, director) %>% 
  
  # We also filtered by the two directors in question
  filter(director %in% c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg")) %>% 

  # In order to compare both directors, we group by this variable
  group_by(director) %>% 
  
  #To calculate the necessary information to run a hypothesis test we use summarise
  summarise (
          mean_rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_rating = sd(rating, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_rating = sd_rating/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_rating,
            lower = mean_rating - t_critical * se_rating,
            upper = mean_rating + t_critical * se_rating
            )


# This line exhibits our calculations
IMBD %>% tbl_df %>% rmarkdown::paged_table()


#Now we are going to replicate the graph

  ggplot(IMBD, 
  aes(x= mean_rating,
  y = reorder(director,mean_rating)))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  
  # The next tree lines include the mean ratings and the upper and lower boundaries of the confidence interval previously calculated
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mean_rating, 2)), size = 6, hjust = 0.5,vjust = -1)+
  
  geom_text(aes(label = round(lower, 2)), hjust = 6, vjust = -2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(upper, 2)), hjust = -5.5, vjust = -2) +
  
  # This line includes the error bar 
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = lower, 
                    xmax = upper, 
                    colour = director, 
                    fill = director), 
                width = 0.1, 
                size = 2) +
  
  # This line includes the shade to the graph in the overlap of the confidence intervals
  geom_rect(xmin = 7.27, xmax = 7.33, ymin = 0, ymax = 10, fill = "grey", aes(alpha = 0.3))+

  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same IMDB ratings",
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap", 
       x = "Mean IMDB ratings", 
       y = "") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
  





```

```{r}

#Now, we wnat to select the date that we will use which is the rating and the directors
steve_tim <- movies %>% 
  select(rating, director) %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg")) 

# In this line we do the ttest with the previously selected data
t.test(rating ~ director, data = steve_tim)


# In order to compare the two methods, we will run the test again using the "infer" package
obs_diff_IMBD <- steve_tim %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg"))


null_dist_IMBD <- steve_tim %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg"))


ggplot(data = null_dist_IMBD, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

null_dist_IMBD %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_IMBD, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist_IMBD %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_IMBD, direction = "two_sided")

```

Using the infer package we get a p-value of 0.006 which is much smaller than 0.05. Then, we can conclude that there is a relevant difference between the mean IMDB ratings for the two directors in question
