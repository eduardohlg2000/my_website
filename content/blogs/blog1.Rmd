What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky?

From the plot it is clear to see that the individuals stocks are more risky than the ETF as their returns are more variable. Morgan Stanley is the riskiest stock with a volatility (standar deviation of the monthly returns) of 9.28% and the least risky, as it was expected, it is the SPY Index with a volatility of 3.81%. This was expected since the ETF is a combination of 500 stocks, which has its systematic risk lowered through diversification.


```{r risk_return_plot}

#Plotting the standard deviation against the mean return for the stocks chosen 
ggplot(analysis, aes(x=sd_return*100, y=mean_return*100,label= symbol))+geom_point() + geom_text_repel()+ labs(title="Relation between the Mean Return and Standard Deviation", x="Standard Deviation (in %)", y="Mean Return (in %)")
```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

From the plot it is possible to see that CS is the worst performing stock within this group and it is the second most risky, which means that it has the lowest sharpe ratio (Return/Volatility), this way, it would have been the worst choice. On the other hand, you can also see that BlackRock (BLK) is the one with the greatest mean return while having a medium volatility compared to its peers. Lastly, comparing Morgan Stanley (MS) with SPY, it's clear to see that it would not have been worth to invest in it as the historical mean returns of both assets were similar.
