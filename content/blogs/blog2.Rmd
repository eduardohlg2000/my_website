# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

Due to the lockdown caused by the COVID19 pandemic, the population that would be in the streets or commuting to work using Boris Bikes has plummeted and this is the reason why the density curves for the months of April, May and June are more skewed to the left and with a lower kurtosis, showing that the frequence and "intensity" of usage of the Santander bikes scheme has lowered during this global pandemic.


However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change-GROUP26"}

# First we filter the data from 2015 and on
bike_monthly <- bike %>% 
  filter(year>="2015")


# Then we group by month and year to summarise by the average of bikes hired in each month of the data
bike_monthly <- bike_monthly %>% 
  group_by(year,month) %>% 
  summarise(bikes_hired = median(bikes_hired))


# After that we group only by month to create a colunm "Average" that is related to average of bikes rented in each month
bike_monthly<- bike_monthly %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  mutate(average= median(bikes_hired))


# Then, we create a column called "Excess_rentals" to know by how many rentals of bikes the month exceeded or was below the expected rentals, which is the average for that month
bike_monthly <- bike_monthly %>% 
  mutate(excess_rentals = bikes_hired - average) %>% 
  ungroup()

# We used the function interpolate in order to make the graphic easier to be comprehended 
bike_interpolated <- bike_monthly  %>% 
  #We splitted the data for each year
  split(.$year) %>% 
  
  #Now we use the map_df function to create columns called year.x, year.y, nat.x and nat.y
  map_df(~data.frame(year = approx(.x$month, .x$bikes_hired, n = 100), 
                     #interpolated months and avg hire
                     nat = approx(.x$month, .x$average, n = 100), 
                     year = .x$year[1],
                     month = .x$month[1]))

#We will use this information to plot the graph in the right order of months and with the exact same name 
month_label <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar",
           "Apr", "May", "Jun",
           "Jul", "Aug","Sep", 
           "Oce", "Nov", "Dec")

#After treating the data, we plot the graph, divided by year 
excess_rentals_graph1 <- ggplot(bike_interpolated, aes(x = nat.x,y= nat.y)) +  facet_wrap(~year) +
  geom_line(color = "#0019f6", size = 0.75) +
  geom_line(aes(nat.x, year.y), color = "black") +
  #No we fill the area between the two plots by using geom_ribbon
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = nat.y, ymax = pmin(year.y, nat.y)), fill = "#deafb1") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = year.y, ymax = pmin(year.y, nat.y)), fill = "#beebc2") +
  #Now we change the theme
  theme_minimal() +
  #After we change the x axis to make in continuous with the interpolated data and using the above mentioned labels
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12),
        labels=month_label) +
  #Then we add the titles
  labs(title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue \nand calculated between 2015-2019",
       caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store",
       y = "Bike rentals",
       x = "") +
  #Lastly, we make the titles bold, when necessary
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        plot.caption = element_text(face = "bold"))

# This line saves the graph as a .jpg file
ggsave("excess_rentals_graph1.jpg",plot=excess_rentals_graph1,width = 10,height = 8)

# And this line includes the above mentioned picture in the HTML knited file
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("excess_rentals_graph1.jpg"))

  
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r tfl_absolute_weekly_change-GROUP26",out.width="100%"}

# First we filter the data from 2015 and on
bike_weekly <- bike %>% 
  filter(year>="2015")

# Then we group by week and year to summarise by the average of bikes hired in each week of the data
bike_weekly <- bike_weekly %>% 
  group_by(year,week) %>% 
  summarise(bikes_hired = median(bikes_hired))

# After that we group only by month to create a colunm "Average" that is related to average of bikes rented in each week
bike_weekly<- bike_weekly %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  mutate(average= median(bikes_hired))


# Then, we create a column called "Rentals_change" to know by how much the weekly rentals has changed compared to the average
bike_weekly <- bike_weekly %>% 
  mutate(rentals_change = ((bikes_hired - average)/average)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  
  #This line of code creates a column that we will use to know if the change of rentals was positive (Above) or negative (Below)

  mutate(rug_colour = if_else(change=="Below","#DEAFB1","#BEEBC2"))

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

In our opinion, we should use the median to calculate the expected rentals. Just as it was pointed in the graph "Distribution of bikes hired per month", there are months that are completely skewed or that have a very low kurtosis (April to June of 2020), then, if we would use the average, the impact of these "outliers" would affect our data and produce results that don't really express the central tendency(median) about the hiring of Boris Bikes.
