# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data

approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
library(lubridate)
approval_polllist_fixdates <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(timestamp = parse_date_time(timestamp, orders = "HMSdmy"),modeldate = mdy(modeldate), startdate = mdy(startdate), enddate = mdy(enddate), createddate = mdy(createddate))

```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_marginsCalc, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
approval_polllist_AvgNetAp <- approval_polllist_fixdates %>% 
  filter(subgroup=="Voters") %>% 
  mutate(week = week(enddate), year=year(enddate)) %>% 
  mutate(Avg_Net_Approval = adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove) %>% 
  group_by(week, year) %>% 
  summarise(Mean = mean(Avg_Net_Approval),
            lower = Mean - qt(0.975, 194)*sd(Avg_Net_Approval)/sqrt(n()),
            upper = Mean + qt(0.975, 194)*sd(Avg_Net_Approval)/sqrt(n())
            ) %>%
  unique(by = c("week", "year")) %>% 
   arrange(year, week)

Approval_plot <- ggplot(approval_polllist_AvgNetAp, aes(x=week,y=Mean, color = as.factor(year))) +   geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~year) + 
  geom_point(size = 1) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color = "gold")+
  labs(title = "Trump's net approval consistently negative", y = "Avg Net Approval (%)", x = "Week") + 
  theme_bw() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower, ymax=upper), linetype=1, alpha=0.1)+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 0.1, decimal.mark = '.'), 
              breaks = c(7.5, 5, 2.5,0.0,-2.5, -5.0, -7.5, -10.0, -12.5, -15.0, -17.5, -20.0))
Approval_plot

```
## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

The confidence intervals increase showing that Trump's supporter and disapprovers further diverged as the evolving economic situation, politics (BLM), and pandemic contributed to uncertainty.
